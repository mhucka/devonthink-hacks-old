# Old DEVONthink Hacks

These are old scripts and programs I developed to work with [DEVONthink Pro](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html), a powerful personal database and information management system. I no longer use these but they're here for reference.

## ☀ Introduction

These are old scripts. They are no longer useful (to me, anyway) and probably do not even run in the latest version of  [DEVONthink Pro](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html).
